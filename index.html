                    <p>&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. 
                      Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. 
                      Ross Perot isn't successful like me. 
                      Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. 
                      Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know it! 
                      Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.

                            I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can join if you pay $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!

                            Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than the initial budget!
